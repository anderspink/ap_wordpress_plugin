The Anders Pink plugin allows you to add widgets to your site which pull in one of your briefings or saved boards from your Anders Pink account.

== Description ==

Add the Anders Pink plugin to your WordPress site to embed your briefings and saved boards from your Anders Pink account.

The plugin comes with a free API key so that you can see the power of embedding the latest content on your site. We also include 8 standard topics that are updated every few hours with fresh content that are free to use.

To make your own curated content, see pricing below. Contact us to buy or arrange a 14 day trial, so you can create your own constantly updating topics.

You can automatically curate content from across the whole of the web. You simply create rules or filters for your curated content and Anders Pink will crawl millions of articles every day to find content that matches your curation rules. For example:

- only articles on leadership from Harvard,
- all articles about elearning trends from across the web,
- articles on Facebook Marketing Tips,
- articles shared by specific elearning influencers,
- articles on social learning from the top 40 elearning blogs
- latest articles published by specific companies such as clients or competitors

You can use any combination of keywords, domains, Twitter influencers or RSS feeds.

Anders Pink delivers the content as a briefing- a collection of articles which is updated every few hours. You can choose to display any number of articles from this briefing automatically.

You can also curate content manually. Simply review the articles Anders Pink brings back each day and save the ones most important to your visitors to a saved board. You can then choose to display this curated content. In this way you can really control the content that is displayed.
